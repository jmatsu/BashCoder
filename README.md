# BashCoder
Bash solutions of [AtCoder](http://atcoder.jp/) problems. 

I also use the commands which can be used in AtCoder system. (include awk, bc and etc)

Probably, source codes will be not POSIX and depend on Bash features and its version.

I would write my code without understandability and/or other xxx-ty.
